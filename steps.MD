To complete this project, follow these essential steps:

Set Up the Project:

Create a new project using your chosen frontend framework (e.g., React).
Set up the development environment with required libraries (React, Bootstrap, or other necessary tools).
Design the Calculator Layout:

Create a basic UI with:
A display area (id="display").
Buttons for numbers (id="zero", id="one", etc.).
Buttons for operators (id="add", id="subtract", etc.).
A clear button (id="clear").
A decimal button (id="decimal").
An equal button (id="equals").
Implement Functionality:

Handle button clicks and update the display accordingly.
Implement logic to perform mathematical operations based on user input.
Ensure that the display updates in real-time as numbers and operators are clicked.
Handle Edge Cases and Constraints:

Prevent multiple zeros at the start of a number.
Allow only one decimal per number.
Ensure correct order of operations (e.g., handle sequences of operators correctly).
Implement Calculation Logic:

Decide whether to use immediate execution logic or formula/expression logic.
Handle operations involving decimals and multiple operators in sequence.
Ensure Precision:

Perform calculations with adequate decimal precision (up to at least four decimal places).
Testing:

Verify that all user stories are met.
Ensure all interactions (button clicks, calculations, edge cases) work correctly.
Use provided tests or write your own to check for correctness.
Deploy and Submit:

Once all tests pass, deploy your app.
